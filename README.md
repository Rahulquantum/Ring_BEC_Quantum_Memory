Research Article: Cavity Optomechanical Quantum Memory for Twisted Photons Using Ring BEC, Nilamoni Daloi, Rahul Gupta, Aritra Ghosh, Pardeep Kumar, Himadri S. Dhar and M. Bhattacharya, 	[arXiv:2506.06651](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.06651).

How to run?
You will need to install Qutip and the Scipy, Numpy packages to run the Jupyter Notebook ("*.ipynb").

You also need Jupyter to open the notebook, but you can also use VS Code instead.

Each notebook in main_text_figures folder can create a specific plot, similar to as it appears in our main research article, the file parameters.ipynb contains all relevant parameters there.
Figures/plots that appear in the supplemental part of our research article can be obtained by codes in folder named supplemental_figures
